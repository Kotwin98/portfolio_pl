            My first steps with programming started when I acidently found a tutorial for c++ on youtube. It got me so intrested that immidiatly after the video I downloaded CodeBlocks and started writing my first lines of code.
            For the next few weeks I had been practicing more and getting better at coding. I wanted to try other technologies and than I got interested in front-end.

          <span className="about_title">Learning</span>
          <p className="about_text">
            From the start of 2019 I had been learning front-end. I finished an intense 9 month long bootcamp with help of an expirianced teacher - Bootcamp Kodilla Web Developer Plus.
            In the meantime I done few courses on Udemy such as React - The Complete Guide, The Complete JavaScript Course.
            Currently I learn alot on my own and I develop my own projects.

            Nowadays I am looking for a job or an internship as Junior Front-end Developer. I learn very fast so I am also ready to take other positions with technologies diffrent than I know.
